Coding Challenge - XMAS HYPERCUBE
=================================

You can run the tests to verify manually that the results are correct for any scenario (input hypercube) you created.
For example the following command will run the test for a 3D input file.

```
node test-3d.mjs
```

The original problem had a 2D matrix of 140 x 140 characters, and it can be run with:

```
node mark-challenge.mjs
```

If you have `manim` installed, you can also play with the `code-challenge-cube-fill.py` to generate the animation I linked to in the blog: https://medium.com/@markvasile/coding-challenge-0abe4085bd3e
